# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Talon Hintze

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?

    5

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |       X       |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    You must have at least 20 markers on the map

    When the user clicks on a marker, a popup must be displayed showing information about the marker. If you are using a mobile app, you can display the information in something native to the platform (e.g. Android Toast).

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

    YouTube, professor tutorial, ChatGPT

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

    I plan on following through the entire tutorial that Bro. Macbeth made before I start my software.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

    I plan on submitting a simple site that has markers on potential camping locations for our family camping trip coming up.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

    I will work on this module for at least one hour after every class period in one of the study rooms in the STC.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

    A behaviorial risk I have had throughout the whole class is carving out the time from my other classes to meet the requirements for each sprint. I have rededicated myself to make sure that all of my work gets done and this will likely mean a reduction in my working hours.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 6/24/24  |  11:39   |   IM   | Starting tutorial                          |    0:42     |
| 6/24/24  |  7:08    |   IM   | Finishing tutorial                         |    1:22     |
| 6/25/24  |  1:24    |   IM   | Finding geojson files and researching      |    1:03     |
| 7/1/24   |  6:20    |   IM   | Implementing new data and popup format     |    1:17     |
| 7/2/24   |  4:44    |   IM   | Making things more pretty and adding data  |    3:14     |
| 7/2/24   |  9:21    |   TP   | Creating master template for html          |    1:28     |
| 7/3/24   |  4:18    |   TP   | Creating links to details for each user    |    1:36     |
| 7/5/24   |  11:30   |   IM   | Documentation and demonstration            |    2:09     |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

    https://github.com/hintzeto/Module-5

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

    https://youtu.be/YyMgRleJXdE

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   X    |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   X    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   X    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   X    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   X    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

    I completed two stretch challenges. I pull data automatically from 2 different data sources online. They are always updated because they are API calls, they come from 2 different sources, and have 2 different markers and popups.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

    No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|      9:47         |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

    One strategy that worked well on a technical level was to follow a template that was similar to what I want as the end product and then to make modifications on it instead of starting over from scratch again.

    On a behaviorial note, something that really helped was to choose a topic I was actually interested in producing. It has been hard to produce code for previous modules because I wasn't particularly excited about them but this one was different and it helped a lot.
