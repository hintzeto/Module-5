## Overview

**Project Title**: Mapping Outdoor Recreation

**Project Description**: An arcgis map that marks camping locations

**Project Goals**: Learn how to use ArcGIS and APIs to create a map that can be used to plan family camping trips.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure to have the newest version of javascript
2. Install the Ritwick Dey Liv Server extension
3. Open the "map.js" file and click the "Go Live" button on the bottom right of VS Code.
4. If you would like to view the "map2.js" version, simply replace "map.js" in the index.html file with "map2.js" and rerun the go live.

Instructions for using the software:

1. The map will automatically center around Idaho
2. Click on any point on the map to view additional information about that site
3. Blue dots come from the USFS dataset and red dots come from blm data from data.gov
